## Objective:
Learn C# while creating a small, simple piano app. The app is nothing more than a do-dad that uses file manipulation for saving playlists, and simple techniques for songs.

## Features:
Piano keyboard GUI (WIP)
Write songs inside of the app and save them.
Can play natural, accidentals, rests and more.
File manipulation and reading to save and load playlist files.
